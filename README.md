My journey in software development began in 2018, and since then, I have been immersed in building innovative solutions and collaborating with teams to create remarkable web, desktop and mobile applications.

I thrive on challenging projects that require detailed coding, web optimization, and web security considerations. My integration of visual arts knowledge allows me to develop functional and appealing custom-made products and services. I love coding and playing video games, and through my coding experiences, I've developed skills such as problem-solving, patience, perseverance, and discipline.
